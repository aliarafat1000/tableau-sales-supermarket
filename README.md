# 📊 Sales and Customer Dashboard Project

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project showcases advanced time series analysis for year-over-year (YoY), month-over-month (MoM), and week-over-week (WoW) sales trends. It breaks down data by categories and subcategories to provide deep insights into sales and profitability. Additionally, it features a dedicated dashboard to analyze customer behavior.

Using Tableau's powerful features such as filters, parameters, and calculated fields, I have created dynamic and interactive visualizations that make data exploration intuitive and insightful. The project also includes data modeling with joins and relationships to structure the data efficiently.
